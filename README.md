## _Python developer_ on [CYBERBIONIC SYSTEMATICS](https://edu.cbsystematics.com/ua)


Here is the basic python homework:

- Lesson #1 "Introduction to Python"
- Lesson #2 "Variables and data types"
- Lesson #3 "Conditional statements"
- Lesson #4 "Loop statements"
- Lesson #5 "Functions 1"
- Lesson #6 "Functions 2"
- Lesson #7 "Lists"

## Lesson #1 "Introduction to Python"
*********************
In this lesson, my instructor and I set up everything needed to create the code.



## Lesson #2 "Variables and data types"
*********************
In this lesson we learned basic things, like "Write a program that asks the user for two words and outputs them separated by commas.", or "Write a program that asks for three integers a, b, and x and prints True if x is between a and b, or False otherwise."

## Lesson #3 "Conditional statements"
*******************
In this lesson, we created a calculator and programs that find the roots of functions.

## Lesson #4 "Loop statements"
******************

Based on the title of the lesson, it is clear that we studied loops

## Lesson #5 "Functions 1"
**************

In this lesson, we learned one of the simplest and most important topics - "functions".

## Lesson #6 "Functions 2"
********************

In this lesson too :)

## Lesson #7 "Lists"
*********************
And for this lesson, you can see the progress that students achieve in just 7 lessons.
